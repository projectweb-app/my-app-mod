        <h2>How to Use the Comma to Line Converter</h2>
        <p>
            Simply paste your text into the input box. If your text is a list separated by commas (like: <strong>item 1, item 2, item 3</strong>), click the "Convert to New Lines" button. The tool will automatically place each item on its own line. If you have a list where each item is on a new line, click "Convert to Commas" to join them into a single, comma-separated line.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is a Text Formatter Useful?</h2>
        <p>
            Data often comes in messy formats. A list of items in an email might be separated by commas, but you might need it as a list in Excel or a Google Sheet, where each item needs to be in its own row. This tool saves you the time of manually editing your text. It's a simple solution for developers, data analysts, and anyone who needs to quickly clean up a list. Our text-to-list converter is fast, free, and works entirely in your browser.
