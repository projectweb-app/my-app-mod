        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: August 26, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Your privacy is fundamentally important to us. Our business is built on providing a great user experience, and that includes guaranteeing the privacy and security of your data.</p>

        <h2>Your Data Never Reaches Us</h2>
        <p>MyAppMod is a "client-side" application. This means that all the logic for our text and data manipulation tools runs entirely within your web browser on your own computer. </p>
        <p><strong>The text or data you paste into any input field on myappmod.com is never sent to, stored on, or processed by our servers.</strong> It never leaves your machine. There is no technical way for us to see, collect, or access the data you are working with.</p>

        <h2>Analytics and Usage Data</h2>
        <p>To understand how our website is used and to improve our tools, we use a privacy-focused analytics platform (such as Plausible or Fathom). This service collects anonymous, aggregate data, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of visitors to our site.</li>
            <li>The pages that are being visited (e.g., how many people use the "Remove Duplicates" tool).</li>
            <li>The average duration of a visit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This analytics data is completely anonymous and contains no personally identifiable information (PII). We do not track your IP address or use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>

        <h2>Contact and Communications</h2>
        <p>If you choose to contact us via email, we will only use your email address to respond to your inquiry. We will not sell or share your email address with any third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.</p>
